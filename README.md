# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## AI Poker Agent

### Model Architecture

The poker agent uses a deep neural network implemented in TensorFlow.js with the following architecture:

```
Input Layer (373 dimensions)
â”œâ”€â”€ Card encoding (364)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Hole cards (2 Ã— 52)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Community cards (5 Ã— 52)
â”œâ”€â”€ Position encoding (6)
â”œâ”€â”€ Stack size (1)
â”œâ”€â”€ Pot size (1)
â””â”€â”€ Pot odds (1)

Hidden Layers
â”œâ”€â”€ Dense Layer 1 (512 units)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Batch Normalization
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ReLU Activation
â”œâ”€â”€ Dense Layer 2 (256 units)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Batch Normalization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ReLU Activation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dropout (0.3)
â””â”€â”€ Dense Layer 3 (128 units)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Batch Normalization
    â”œâ”€â”€ ReLU Activation
    â””â”€â”€ Dropout (0.3)

Output Layer (4 dimensions)
â””â”€â”€ Softmax Activation
    â”œâ”€â”€ FOLD  (0)
    â”œâ”€â”€ CHECK (1)
    â”œâ”€â”€ CALL  (2)
    â””â”€â”€ RAISE (3)
```

### Training Configuration

- **Optimizer**: Adam
  - Initial learning rate: 0.001
  - Beta1: 0.9
  - Beta2: 0.999
  - Learning rate decay: 1e-5

- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
  - Suitable for multi-class classification
  - Optimizes probability distribution

- **Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Validation loss
  - Validation accuracy

### Forward Pass

1. **Input Processing**
   - Cards are one-hot encoded (52 dimensions per card)
   - Position is one-hot encoded (6 dimensions)
   - Stack and pot values are normalized to [0,1]

2. **Hidden Layer Processing**
   - Each dense layer applies linear transformation
   - Batch normalization stabilizes training
   - ReLU activation adds non-linearity
   - Dropout prevents overfitting

3. **Output Generation**
   - Softmax produces action probabilities
   - Values sum to 1.0
   - Highest probability indicates recommended action

### Memory Management

- Tensor disposal after predictions
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Automatic garbage collection
- Memory-efficient forward pass

### Model Usage

```javascript
// Create and build model
const model = new PokerModel();
model.buildModel();

// Make prediction
const gameState = {
  holeCards: ['Ah', 'Kh'],
  communityCards: ['Qh', 'Jh', 'Th'],
  position: POSITIONS.BTN,
  stack: 1000,
  potSize: 100,
  betAmount: 20
};

// Transform state to input tensor
const input = transformer.transformState(gameState);

// Get action probabilities
const probs = await model.predict(input);
// Example output: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]

// Get best action
const action = await model.getBestAction(input);
// Example output: 3 (RAISE)
```

### Performance

- Forward pass: <1ms
- Memory usage: ~350KB
- Parameters: 356,228
  - Input â†’ Dense1: 191,488
  - Dense1 â†’ Dense2: 131,328
  - Dense2 â†’ Dense3: 32,896
  - Dense3 â†’ Output: 516

```

## Usage
```javascript
const pipeline = new TrainingPipeline({
  learningRate: 0.0002,
  batchSize: 32,
  maxEpochs: 100
});

await pipeline.train();
```

## AI Testing

The AI system includes several test suites:

```bash
# Run all AI tests
npm run test:ai

# Individual test suites
npm run test:ai-data        # Test data processing
npm run test:ai-hand        # Test hand evaluation
npm run test:ai-input       # Test input transformation
npm run test:ai-model       # Test poker model
npm run test:ai-data-loader # Test data loading
npm run test:ai-trainer     # Test model training
npm run test:ai-pipeline    # Test training pipeline
npm run test:ai-optimization # Test performance optimization
```

Recent updates:
- Implemented gradient accumulation
- Added memory leak detection
- Fixed tensor cleanup
- Improved training pipeline validation

## Learning Rate Scheduling

The training pipeline now includes dynamic learning rate scheduling:

```javascript
const scheduler = new LRScheduler(0.1, {
  schedule: 'exponential',  # or 'step'
  decayRate: 0.1,
  minLR: 1e-7,
  warmupSteps: 1000
});
```

### Available Schedules
- **Step Decay**: Reduces learning rate by a factor after N epochs
- **Exponential Decay**: Smoothly decreases learning rate over time
- **Warmup Period**: Gradually increases learning rate at start

### Features
- Configurable decay rates
- Minimum learning rate protection
- Warmup period support
- Automatic schedule selection
