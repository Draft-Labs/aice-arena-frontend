# AI Poker Training System Scope

## Overview
A machine learning system for training an AI poker agent using hand history data. The system processes poker hand histories, converts them into a neural network-friendly format, and trains a model to predict optimal actions.

## Core Components

### Data Processing
- [x] Hand History Parser
  - [x] IRC format support
  - [x] Card encoding (52-bit one-hot)
  - [x] Action encoding
  - [x] Position encoding
  - [x] Pot size normalization
  - [x] Error handling for malformed hands

### Data Representation
- [x] Input Vector Format
  - [x] First 52 bits: Hole cards
  - [x] Next 260 bits (5 x 52): Community cards
  - [x] Next 6 bits: Position
  - [x] Next 1 bit: Normalized pot size
  - [x] Final 2 bits: Last action type

- [x] Output Vector Format
  - [x] 4 possible actions (fold, check/call, raise, all-in)
  - [x] One-hot encoded
